Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying coins in images using machine learning techniques implemented with NumPy. The goal is to create a robust model that can accurately identify various coin types based on their visual features. This application can be useful in fields like automated vending machines, coin sorting, and inventory management.

Features
Image Preprocessing: Techniques to enhance image quality and prepare it for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Utilizing NumPy to compute essential features from the images, such as edges and contours.
Machine Learning Model: Training a model using extracted features to classify different coin types.
Prediction: Using the trained model to detect and classify coins in new images.
Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
OpenCV
Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
Matplotlib (for visualizing results)
Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the necessary packages:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coin-detection.git
cd coin-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare Dataset: Collect images of different coin types. Organize them into training and testing sets.
Preprocess Images: Run the preprocessing script to enhance and normalize the images.
Feature Extraction: Use NumPy to extract features from the processed images.
Train Model: Execute the training script to create a model based on the extracted features.
Evaluate Model: Test the model using the testing dataset to evaluate its accuracy.
Predict: Use the prediction script to classify coins in new images.
Example
python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import cv2
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load and preprocess images
